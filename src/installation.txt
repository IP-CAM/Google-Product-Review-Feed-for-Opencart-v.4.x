Playful Sparkle - Google Product Review Feed

Playful Sparkle - Google Product Review Feed is a powerful extension for
OpenCart 4.x+ that allows store owners to export and submit customer product
reviews to their Google Merchant Center account. This enables the display of
verified user-generated reviews alongside product listings in Google Shopping
and other Google services.

About Google Merchant Center

Google Merchant Center is a platform where businesses upload their product data
to make it available across Google Shopping and other Google surfaces.
In addition to product feeds, Google also supports product review feeds, which
allow merchants to display aggregated customer ratings and reviews.

The Google Product Review Feed extension complements your existing product data
feed by submitting customer reviews collected from your OpenCart store to
Google Merchant Center. This enhances product listings with social proof and
contributes to better visibility and trust on Google's shopping network.

- Product Review Feed Generation: Generates a compliant product review feed that

  related services.
- Frontend authentication: Secure access to the review feed by preventing
