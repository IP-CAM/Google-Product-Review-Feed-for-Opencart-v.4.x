Playful Sparkle - Google Product Review Feed

Playful Sparkle - Google Product Review Feed is an essential extension for
OpenCart 4.x+ that allows store owners to automatically generate and submit a
product review feed from their OpenCart store to their Google Merchant
Center account. This extension enables you to display verified customer reviews
from your store on Google Shopping and other Google platforms, enhancing trust
and visibility for your products.

## About Google Merchant Center

Google Merchant Center is a platform provided by Google where businesses
upload their product data to make it available across Google Shopping,
Google Search, and other Google services. In addition to product data,
Google Merchant Center also supports product review feeds. This feature allows
merchants to display aggregated customer ratings and reviews for their products,
improving product visibility, increasing customer trust, and boosting
shopper engagement.

With the Google Product Review Feed extension, your OpenCart store will
generate a product review feed containing customer reviews collected from
your store. You can submit this feed URL to your Google Merchant Center account.
Google Merchant Center will periodically fetch updated reviews from the feed
according to the frequency you set in your Google Merchant Center settings.
This ensures that your product listings are consistently updated with the
latest customer reviews.
